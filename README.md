<h1>Hi, I'm Katrina! 🌱⭐️ <br/></h1>

I'm a college student studying computer science and teaching, currently exploring different paths I can take with this field. I enjoy making and designing webpages in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as they are a great way to showcase my ideas and creativity for everyone to see. <br/><br/>

For my programming projects, I typically only upload them to Github once I make significant progress, but I do make commits quite often.
